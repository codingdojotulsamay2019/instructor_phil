Python Day 6 – Flask + MySQL
1. What is SQL?
2. Based on the data given, draw the
associated ERD diagram:
3. Using the data to the left, write queries to:
-get all the artists
-get all the works, ordered by their creation year
-get all the artists who were born during the 19th century (January 1, 1801 – December 31, 1900)
-get all the works that start with “The”
-add the artist Leonardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 – May 2, 1519) (or your own favorite artist)
-add Mona Lisa (1503), which was painted by da Vinci
-update the title Autumn Rhythm to Autumn Rhythm (Number 30)
-remove Jackson Pollock from the database
-list all the works of art, with their associated artist


4. What does the PyMySQL package do for us?


5. Assuming I have the correct files and database (schema name is ‘art’) set up, complete the file
below:

from flask import Flask, render_template
from mysqlconnection import connectToMySQL

app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route(“/”)
def index():
    # this route should show all the artists
    db = connectToMySQL(‘art’) # make a connection to the db
    all_artists = "SELECT * FROM artists;"
    return render_template(“index.html”, artists=all_artists)

@app.route(“/artists/<id>”)
def show_artist(id):
    # this route should display the single artist’s information
    query = "SELECT * FROM artists WHERE id = %(id)s;"
    data = {"id":id}
    db = connectToMySQL(‘art’) # make a connection to the db
    one_artist = db.query_db(query, data)
    # BONUS: also display all the artist’s works of art
    # query = "SELECT * FROM artist JOIN works_of_art ON artist.id = works_of_art.artist_id;"
    # db = connectToMySQL(‘art’) # make a connection to the db
    # artists_with_art = db.query_db(query)
    return render_template(“artist.html”, artist = one_artist)

if __name__ == “__main__”:
    app.run(debug=True)
